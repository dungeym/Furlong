# Furlong
Furlong provides several implementations of the Chain of Responsibility pattern, supporting sync, async-await, request, request-response, and local delegates (also using async-await, et al).

## Introduction
This ```netstandard2.0``` library contains several implementations of the *Chain of Responsibility* pattern, one of the Behavioural Patterns from the [Gang of Four](http://wiki.c2.com/?GangOfFour).  

Each implementation has the following characteristics.
-  A **chain** represents two or more **links**.
-  A **chain** can only be accessed by the first **link**.
-  Each **link** determines if the **request** should be passed to the next **link** in the **chain**.

### Installation
Install the library from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Furlong/" title="Furlong on NuGet">NuGet</a> using:
``` csharp
dotnet add package Furlong
```

### Basic Examples
Simple chain with no response.
```csharp
var chain = ChainFactory<MyRequest>
		.Initialize()
		.StartWith(new MyLink1())
		.FollowedBy(new MyLink2())
		.FollowedBy(new MyLink3())
		.Build();

var request = new MyRequest();

chain.Handle(request);
```

Asynchronous chain returning a response.
```csharp
var chain = AsyncChainFactory<MyRequest>
		.Initialize()
		.StartWith(new MyLink1())
		.FollowedBy(new MyLink2())
		.FollowedBy(new MyLink3())
		.Build();

var request = new MyRequest();

var source = new CancellationTokenSource();

var response = await chain.HandleAsync(request, source.Token);
```

Synchronous chain using local delegates, with no response.
```csharp
var chain = LocalChainFactory<MyRequest>
		.Initialize()
		.StartWith(Handle1)
		.FollowedBy(Handle2)
		.FollowedBy(Handle3)
		.Build();

var request = new MyRequest();

chain.Handle(request);

private void Handle1(MyRequest request, out bool cancel)
{
	cancel = false;
	
	// Do something..
}
```
